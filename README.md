# digcli.py

This is a simple client for digitalesregister.it written in python.

To not have to enter the password every time, edit the source-code
directly and change `json_data` to:
```
json_data = {
        "username":"<username>",
        "password":"<password>"
}
```

## installation

`sudo cp digcli.py /usr/local/bin/`
